# IBM FHIR Server - Demo
This module contains a minimal docker-compose environment to facilitate demonstrations and evaluations from a single-node system (e.g. from your laptop).

### Prerequisites
A functional docker-compose and enough storage (~4GB) and RAM (~4GB) to run the environment.

### Using docker-compose
First, navigate to the `demo/basic` directory.
Then execute the following commands.

To start the services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

To monitor the services:
```
docker-compose logs -f
```

To stop the services:
```
docker-compose down
```

### Using the LinuxForHealth FHIR Server
Once the server is running, navigate to http://localhost:9080/openapi/ui to explore the server endpoints.

### Adding implementation guides
The LinuxForHealth FHIR Server can be extended with conformance resources from FHIR implementation guides as described at https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRValidationGuide.

If the LinuxForHealth FHIR Server team has already packaged the desired implementation guide, you can use a command like the following to ask Maven to download the latest version of this IG jar to the mounted userlib directory:
```
mvn dependency:copy -DoutputDirectory=fhir/userlib -Dartifact=net.sovrinhealth.fhir:fhir-ig-us-core:LATEST
```

### Limitations
To speed up the schema deployment and keep the schema size down, this demo environment is limited to the following resource types:
* AllergyIntolerance
* CarePlan
* CareTeam
* CodeSystem
* Condition
* Coverage
* Device
* DiagnosticReport
* DocumentReference
* Encounter
* ExplanationOfBenefit
* Goal
* Group
* Immunization
* List
* Location
* Medication
* MedicationAdministration
* MedicationDispense
* MedicationRequest
* Observation
* Organization
* Patient
* Practitioner
* PractitionerRole
* Procedure
* Provenance
* StructureDefinition
* ValueSet

To adjust the list of supported resource types, change the `resourceTypes` property in start command of the fhir-server in docker-compose.yml. To support all resource types, you can omit the resourceTypes property entirely.

In addition, the set of supported resource endpoints must be adjusted in the server config at `fhir/config/default/fhir-server-config.json`. Add entries for each resource type you wish to support, or set `fhirServer/resources/open` to `true` to support all resource types. See the [User's Guide](https://linuxforhealth.github.io/FHIR/guides/FHIRServerUsersGuide#412-fhir-rest-api) for more information.

Finally, to update the OpenAPI, you may use the `fhir-swagger-generator` to generate a new definition and use that to replace the `openapi.json` that is mounted via docker-compose.
