Level II alphanumeric procedure and modifier codes comprise the A to V range.\n\nGeneral information can be found here: [https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenInfo](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/MedHCPCSGenInfo)\n\nReleases can be found here: [https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets)\n\nThese files contain the Level II alphanumeric HCPCS procedure and modifier codes, their long and short descriptions, and applicable Medicare administrative, coverage and pricing data.",
