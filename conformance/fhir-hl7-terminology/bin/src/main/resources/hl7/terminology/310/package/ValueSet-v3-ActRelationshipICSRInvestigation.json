    "description": "**Description:** The ways that product safety Investigations, about which information is captured in an Individual Case Safety Report, are related to each other. One investigation may be performed at a patient care institution, and the second by a manufacturer, a third by a regulatory agency. They may all investigate the same case and are thus related. Other kinds of relationships are replacement (if the mode of the Investigation is changed).",
