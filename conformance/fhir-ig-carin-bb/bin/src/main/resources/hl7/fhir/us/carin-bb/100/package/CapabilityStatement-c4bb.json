    "description": "This Section describes the expected capabilities of the C4BB Server actor which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted by the C4BB Requestors. \n\nThe EOB Resource is the focal Consumer-Directed Payer Data Exchange (CDPDE) Resource. Several Reference Resources are defined directly/indirectly from the EOB: Coverage, Patient, Organization (Payer ID), Practioner, and Organization (Facility).\n\nThe Coverage Reference Resource SHALL be returned with data that was effective as of the date of service of the claim; for example, the data will reflect the employer name in effect at that time. However, for other reference resources, payers MAY decide to provide either the data that was in effect as of the date of service or the current data. All reference resources within the EOB will have meta.lastUpdated flagged as must support. Payers SHALL provide the last time the data was updated or the date of creation in the payers system of record, whichever comes last. Apps will use the meta.lastUpdated values to determine if the reference resources are as of the current date or date of service.",
