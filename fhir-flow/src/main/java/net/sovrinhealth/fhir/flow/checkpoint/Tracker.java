/**
 * Tracks units of work which arrive in a sequence but can be
 * executed in parallel. A checkpoint represents a point in the
 * sequence for which all units up to and including that point
 * have been completed. If processing needs to be restarted,
 * the checkpoint can be used to request work units that come
 * after that point in the sequence.
 * 
 * Implemented as our own single-linked list, where each node is also
 * used as the returned ITrackerTicket. Upon completion, we simply
 * mark the node as done.
 * 
 * Completed nodes are not removed from the queue until a checkpoint
 * is requested. This allows us to avoid any synchronization on the
 * queue data structure which could lead to contention. This means 
 * that the {@link #addNode(long)} and {@link #getCheckpoint()} methods
 * are not thread-safe by design. Only the main history fetch controller
 * thread should be calling these methods anyway, so this is not a
 * problem in practice.
